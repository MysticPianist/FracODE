# FracODE

FracODE is a Python module for solving and visualizing fractional ordinary differential equation initial value problems. This served as a foundation for testing various SIR models as they pretain to modeling epidemiological data. Includes parameter fitting options using a custom gradient descent optimizer. Numerical calculations are derived from the work of Kolade M. Owolabi and Abdon Atangana in _Numerical Methods for Fractional Differentiation_.
